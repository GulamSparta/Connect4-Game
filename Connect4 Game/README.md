Today I added the following features:
> Added a grid menu to show the user where the boarder starts and end
> I added the menu so that the user can be loaded into the game
> I added the images on top of the button so that it shows me the counter
> I added an exit button that asks the user if they wanted to leave
> 
> 
> 

Tommorrow I will add/fix:
The counter so that the users take turns
Fix the placeholder images
Game over screen
Adjust the menu
