Today I added the following features:

Day 1 Implementations 

> Added a grid menu to show the user where the boarder starts and end
> I added the menu so that the user can be loaded into the game
> I added the images on top of the button so that it shows me the counter
> Added the place holder counter images in the files

> 
> 
> 

Tommorrow I will add/fix:
The counter so that the users take turns
