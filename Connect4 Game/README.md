This project was my attempt at making a Connect4 game using WPF. The goal of the game was to make sure that both players would try to get 4 red or yellow counters in the row then they win. 

Day 1 Implementations:

> Added a grid menu to show the user where the boarder starts and end
> I added the menu so that the user can be loaded into the game
> I added the images on top of the button so that it shows me the counter
> Added the place holder counter images in the files
> I added an exit button that asks the user if they wanted to leave
> 
> 
> 

Tomorrow I will add/fix:
The counter so that the users take turns
Fix the placeholder images
Game over screen
Adjust the menu
Will add a test menu to test some things on a different menu to keep the main area clean

Day 2 Implementations:

> Fixed the GRID and enlarged it
> The counters work properly
> Fixed the menu not loading up the game
> Fixed the new game
> Adjusted the menu and added a few images
> Removed the placeholder images

Tomorrow I will add/fix

Day 3 Implementations:
> Recreated the GRID
> Improved the game design with a better GRID
> Fixed crashing when closing the game
> Fixed the resize glitch that was causing the main menu to stretch things

What did I learn during this project?

I learnt how to use GRIDS and how to create them using XML. I also learnt a little bit about calling data from grids.
I understand more about using XML and know how to create a GRID from scratch using XML
I learnt about event handlers and how to give the same function to all buttons without copying the code to every single button.
I learnt how to maintain the code and keeping it simple.
I increased my knowledge in WPF

The tools I used during my project

When I had an error I used the breakpoint to pinpoint my errors and fix them
I used the "rebuild solution" to fix the problem when visual studio wouldn't remove the error

What could I do to improve the project?

I think I could of done some more research to give me a clear plan in which I could follow in order to make the game work, I was also new to WPF so this means that I needed to re-learn how the interface works compared to the normal windows form. I used WPF a few times before, so I had to do some research on features. I would also like to make the GUI neater because I just put all around the place. I also wanted to make it so that the user could add their names to red counter and then the game would have their names on the side so that they could see their scores and record it on the database.

The types of problems that occurred

I had issues trying to find a way to make the GRID find if the four buttons are coloured in a row.
